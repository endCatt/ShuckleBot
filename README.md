# ShuckleBot

Shucklebot is just a bot for fun trying to figure out the different commands of discord.js

The megaShuckle branch will attempt to connect what I learned about discord.js last fall to a refined bot that will launch in meatroof eventually.

In the future, a QuagsireBot will run using discord.py, though the first priority is fixing up ShuckleBot
